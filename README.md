# Virtual Assistant

Have you ever considered having your own virtual assistant? Consider how much easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, perform Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and perform a variety of other daily tasks with a single voice command. I created a personal virtual assistant in Python for this project.

What all can this V.A. do for you?
  1. It can send emails on your behalf.
  2. It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
  3. It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
  4. It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
